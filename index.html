                    <br>
                    <p class="text-sec-2 t3"> One Piece is the name the world gave to all the treasure gained by the Pirate King Gol D. Roger. At least a portion of it once belonged to Joy Boy during the Void Century. The treasure is said to be of unimaginable value, and is currently located on Laugh Tale , the final island of the Grand Line.

                    The One Piece is the driving goal of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, as well as that of multiple other pirates, who all seek to claim the treasure in order to become the next Pirate King, following Roger's dying words at his execution.

                    <h3> Medias </h3>

                    <p class="text-sec-2 t3"> The manga is now known worldwide by every anime lover. The series made its first appearance in 1997 in the magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump, and then the first volume was released in the same year. Today, in 2024, there are three different versions: the manga, the anime, and the live-action adaptation. In 2025, a remake will be released, making the anime shorter and visually improved for the early arcs. This will allow people, depending on their taste, to start One Piece without being intimidated by its length.

                         <p class="d-flex text-sec-3 t1"> One Piece Live-Action is a show produced by Netflix that premiered in 2023. Currently, one season has aired, and a second season has been announced. The series was created to make it accessible for everyone to enjoy One Piece, condensing the different arcs into shorter episodes, as the anime is quite long. The first season covers the East Blue arc, where Luffy meets his first crew members: Zoro the swordman, Nami the navigator, Sanji the chef and Usopp the sharpshooter.

                         As they come together, we learn about their backstories and the traumas that drive them to push forward in their adventures. These rich backstories not only deepen our understanding of their characters but also highlight the bonds they form as they navigate their shared dreams and fears. Together, they embark on a journey of self-discovery, learning that their pasts don't define them, but rather strengthen their resolve to pursue their goals as a united crew.

                    <p class="d-flex text-sec-4 t2"> Yes, you are reading this right: Netflix has announced a remake of One Piece that will be produced by WIT Studio! The project aims to pick up the animation of the last 1,000 episodes and present them in a larger format (the original episodes were in a 4:3 aspect ratio). The studio also plans to make the arcs shorter, with fewer episodes, while retaining the essence of the original story. Nevertheless, we still don't have any information about its release date or the casting.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Here is a message from Eiichiro Oda, the creator of One Piece, regarding the remake: “I hope you will see it with a new perspective. That is the case. The release is still a long way off, and this is a long-term project that will take a lot of time to come to fruition. However, with our new friends, WIT Studio and Netflix, we hope to reach fans all over the world, as well as a new generation who will discover One Piece. We will do our best with the 'ALL ONE PIECE' team. I will do my best!”
