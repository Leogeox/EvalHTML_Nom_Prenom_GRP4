                <h1>One Piece OP1 "We Are !" (1999)</h1>
                <p>One Piece is the name the world gave to all the treasure gained by the Pirate King Gol D. Roger. At least a portion of it once belonged to Joy Boy during the Void Century. The treasure is said to be of unimaginable value, and is currently located on Laugh Tale , the final island of the Grand Line.

                The One Piece is the driving goal of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, as well as that of multiple other pirates, who all seek to claim the treasure in order to become the next Pirate King, following Roger's dying words at his execution.

            <p class="text-cordonner"> One piece is now know worlwide by every anime's lover. The serie made its first appearence in 1997 in the magazine "Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump", and then realised the first manga in the same year. Today, in 2024, we have 3 differents versions, the Manga, Anime and the Live-action. In 2025, it's remake will be released, making the anime shorter and better looking for the firsts arcs. That leave people, depending of their taste, to start One Piece without being scared of it's lenght.
